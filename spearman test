#Spearman correlation between smoking pack years VS mutation count using nsclc_tcga_broad_2016_clinical_data
##first step is for better visualization install and load ggplot2 library

> install.packages("ggplot2")
> library(ggplot2)

##IMPORT DATA SET (clinical data set from cBioPortal) for any cancer type you like in this study the dataset I utilized was NSCLC pan analysis 2016.
##.tsv file can easily be uploaded via import datasets from txt

#This is a basic spearman correlation test only used when the variables in the data collected are not equally distributes .
##The study was designed to establish a correlation between to axis X= Person.Cigarette.Smoking.History.Pack.Year.Value and Y= Mutation.Count.
##R is highly case sensitive use caps/smalls wherever required

## COMMAND LINE FOR CORRELATION TEST
> cor.test(nsclc_tcga_broad_2016_clinical_data$Person.Cigarette.Smoking.History.Pack.Year.Value, nsclc_tcga_broad_2016_clinical_data$Mutation.Count, metho= "spearman")

## OUTPUT
### Rho= 0.16 (weak correlation but significant)
### p-value<0.001 (statistically significant)
##if the results along with the values showed cannot compute exact p-values with ties,, it shows they are safe to ignore as data had some repeated values
## visualize with ggplot2
